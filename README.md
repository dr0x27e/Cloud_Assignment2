## Overview

This project consists of two main parts:

1. **Cloud Service (Go)** - A backend service with five endpoints that handle registrations, dashboards, notifications, and API status.
2. **Python API** - A separate service that performs image classification to detect cats and/or dogs, and integrates with the cloud service for event-based notifications (webhooks).

## Cloud Service

### Endpoints

The cloud service exposes the following endpoints:

---

#### 1. Registrations

**URL:** `http://10.212.168.208:8080/dashboard/v1/registrations/`

This endpoint manages the registration of country-related data to Firebase.

- **POST**: Create a new registration  
- **GET**: Retrieve all registrations  
- **GET [ID]**: Retrieve a specific registration by ID  
- **PUT [ID]**: Update a specific registration  
- **PATCH [ID]**: Partially update a specific registration  
- **DELETE [ID]**: Delete a specific registration  

**Example Request Body (POST):**

```json
{
  "country": "Norway",
  "isoCode": "NO",
  "features": {
    "temperature": true,
    "precipitation": true,
    "capital": true,
    "coordinates": true,
    "population": true,
    "area": true,
    "targetCurrencies": ["EUR", "USD", "SEK"]
  }
}
```

---

#### 2. Dashboards

**URL:** `http://10.212.168.208:8080/dashboard/v1/dashboards/`

Retrieves and transformed data from Firebase based on a given registration ID. Only the features set to true in the registration will be included in the response.

- **GET [ID]**: Retrive and transformed registration by ID

**Example Response:**

```json
{
  "country": "Norway",
  "isoCode": "NO",
  "features": {
    "temperature": -1.2,
    "precipitation": 0.80,
    "capital": "Oslo",
    "coordinates": {
      "latitude": 62.0,
      "longitude": 10.0
    },
    "population": 5379475,
    "area": 323802.0,
    "targetCurrencies": {
      "EUR": 0.087701435,
      "USD": 0.095184741,
      "SEK": 0.97827275
    }
  },
  "lastRetrieval": "20250229 18:15"
}
```

---

#### 3. Notifications

**URL:** `http://10.212.168.208:8080/dashboard/v1/notifications/`

Manages webhooks related to the registration events **(REGISTER, CHANGE, DELETE, INVOKE, PREDICT)**. These webhooks notify external services based on specified events.


- **POST**: Create a new webhook
- **GET**: Retrive all webhooks
- **GET [ID]**: Retrive a spesific webhook by its ID
- **DELETE [ID]**: Delete a spesific webhook

**Example Request Body (POST):**

```json
{
  "url": "https://localhost:8080/client/",
  "country": "NO",
  "event": "INVOKE"
}
```

---

#### 4. Status

**URL:** `http://10.212.168.208:8080/dashboard/v1/status/`

Checks the status of all external APIs that the service relies on (Python API included).

- **GET**: Retrive the status of external APIs and uptime of the service

---

#### 5. Predict

**URL:** `http://10.212.168.208:8080/api/predict/`

Receives an image and returns predictions about the presence of cats and/or dogs, utilizing a custom-trained AI model. Notifications are triggered when a prediction is made for webhooks subscribed to the "PREDICT" event

- **POST**: Submit an image for prediction (Does not always predict correctly)

**Example Request:**
```bash
curl -X POST -F "file=@./picture.jpg" "http://10.212.168.208/api/predict/"
```

---

## Python API

The Python API is a separate service that runs independently on **another instance** in OpenStack. It listens to the /api/predict/ endpoint from the **go service** and performs image classification to detect cats and dogs.
*Its made of a model that we created in the course **PROG2051***

### Endpoints

---

#### test

**URL:** `http://10.212.170.29:5000/test`

Returns current status of API - used in /status/ endpoint in go service

---

#### predict

**URL:** `http://10.212.170.29:5000/predict`

- **POST**: Upload an image for prediction. The Python API returns a JSON response with detected classes (Dog/Cat) and their respective confidence scores aswell as bounding boxes.

**Example Response:**

```json
{
    predictions": [
    {
        "grid":[3,3],
        "probability":0.739352285861969,
        "xmin":0.4771217703819275,
        "ymin":0.5398383736610413,
        "xmax":0.397176057100296,
        "ymax":0.6730109453201294,
        "class":"Dog"
    }
    ]
}
```

The image is split into a 7x7 grid and resized to 224 x 224, "grid" is the grid that the class is in, probability is the confidence of the model 
xmin, ymin, xmax and ymax are the coordinates "Normalized (/224)" of the smallest box that can contain the entire class ("Dog in this case")
